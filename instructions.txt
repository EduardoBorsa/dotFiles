"#Hot to link your vimrc
"move the .vimrc to the folder you want
"use ln -s code/dotFiles/vim/vimrc
"the file vimrc will hold the configurations

To insure that your dot files are working, you must:

1)Check what dotFiles you need to mode:
	- .vimrc
	- .tmux.conf
	- .oh-my-zsh //  thinking if this is really necessary
		#Remember: the oh-my-zsh has its own folder inside the dotfiles. It os NOT inside the zsh.
		#Dont know if i will use this... Anyway the site:
		http://ohmyz.sh/
	- .zplug  // thinking if this is really necessary
		#https://github.com/zplug/zplug.
	- .zshrc
		# we need to set as first shelll with this command:
		# which zsh  // show where it is.
		# then : chsh -s "The path Where it is located"

2) link the dotFile:

	ln -n code/dotFiles/NameOfTheTool/FileThatHoldTheConfig
