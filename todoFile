  It alias the current module

What does the @enforce_keys does?
  To ensure that when we create a new struct, all attributes that
  are inside the enforce keys must be filled.
  i.e: @enforce_keys [:row,col]
       defstruct [:row, :col]

What are some mix tasks?
  mix docs - show docs

What is function arity?
  The nuber of arguments you can pass to the function.

-------------------------------- PHOENIX_LIKE_QUESTIONS -----

How does Phoenix.HTML works?
  * The link function inside this module works as an anger Tag.
    i.e: <%= link("Text of the link"), to: "/path/you/want",
    class= "bootstrap-classes-names"%>

  * form_for -> helps to create forms. Check the url: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html


Why when you nest a controller inside another, you have to override the action/2 (action(conn,_) function? What is this funcion?

What is an endpoint in a web application?

How to create a Json API with Phoenix?
  mix phx.gen.json SchemaName ContextName tableName attributes
      ---------------Inside the Business Part ----
      Created a new SchemaFile.ex and Context.ex inside the new SchemaNameFolder
      and a migration
      and tests related
      ---------------Inside the Web Part ----------
      created a context controller, view
      a changeset_view (pra que serve isso?)
      a fallback_controller (pra que serve isso?)
      and tests related


What is an schema in Phoenix?

How does the mix phx.gen.html works?
  R: I think it is:
      mix phx.gen.html SchemaName ContextName tableName atributes
      ---------------Inside the Business Part ----
      In the business part of the system, it creates a folder with SchemaDirectory and create a SchemaName.ex with its name, i.e forums.ex. It also creates a context.ex .
      Inside the SchemaName.ex file is where all the CRUD operations of all the business logics inside the SchemaDirectory wiil be stored.
      The ContextName.ex will hold all the atributes and changeset of the new context.
      ---------------Inside the Web Part ----------
      In the webPart of the system, it creates a schemaName_controller in the controller folder. And creates a folder inside templates with schemaName with the html.eex files. Also creates inside view a schemaName_view
      inside the controller is the webconventions functions of: (1) index, (2) new, (3) create, (4) show, (5) edit, (6) update and (7) delete.

What is the config/config.ex file?


How do I use Phoenix Sign up.



How do I create a Oauth on github:
  1) settings
  2) Developer Settings
  3) New Oauth App
  4) App_Name: Name,
     Localhost: localhost:4000,
     Authorization_URL: localhost:4000/auth/github
  5) Create a .env file inside config/, i.e -> ./config/.env
  6) add the environment variable as example:
                                              export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<My Github client id>"
                                              export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<My Github Client Secret>"
  7) Before Running the Application, use the command:
                                                    source ./config/.env

How can I authenticate a user?
  Using OAuth -
    1) Add in mix these two:  {:ueberauth, "~> 0.4"},
                              {:ueberauth_github, "~> 0.4"}
    2) Add the following config:  config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
                                  providers: [
                                    # We don't need any permissions on GitHub as we're just using it as an
                                    # identity provider, so we'll set an empty default scope.
                                    github: {Ueberauth.Strategy.Github, [default_scope: ""]}
                                  ]

                                  # We also need a github client id and secret. I've already generated an
                                  # application on github and I've stored these secrets somewhere...secret.
                                  config :ueberauth, Ueberauth.Strategy.Github.OAuth,
                                    client_id: System.get_env("GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"),
                                    client_secret: System.get_env("GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET")
    3) Inside the router.ex, add ueberauth to plug stack:
       * in the first prosition of Browser pipeline add: plug(Ueberauth)
       And add a scope for the authAuthentication, as, exmaple:
                                                              scope "/auth", FirestormWeb.Web do
                                                              pipe_through :browser

                                                              delete "/logout", AuthController, :delete
                                                              get "/logout", AuthController, :delete
                                                              get "/:provider", AuthController, :request
                                                              get "/:provider/callback", AuthController, :callback
                                                              post "/:provider/callback", AuthController, :callback
                                                            end


How do I authenticate users using comeonin?
  add the librarie: comeonin 4.0
                    bcrypt_elixir 1.0

  It is needed to create a new changeset for the registration
  that will hold some validate_required fields.
  Alse, we'll need to create a digest function like this one:
  defp put_pass_digest(changeset) do
    case changeset do
    %Ecto.Changeset{valid?: true, changes: %{password: pass}} ->
      put_change(changeset, :password_digest, Comeonin.Bcrypt.hashpwsalt(pass))
    _ ->
      changeset
    end
  end
How to enable log in?
  Create a SchemaAuthController wit:
  init
  call
How to restrict unauthenticated?
  in the controller of the function you want to restrict, plug
  an authenticate function to it
  i.e: plug :authenticate when action in [:functionToRestrict]

------------------------------ DATABASE_LIKE_QUESTIONS -----
How to work with associations?

  In the schema file, add the association.
  i.e: has_may(:threads, Thread).
  In this case, the category has many thread, but nothings says
  that it has this, I mean, in the DB
  The posts already had foreign keys to user and thread, In the
  schema we changed the "user_id, :id" and thread_id for
  belongs_to :user, User.
  It seams to me that the has_many realy means nothing for the
  DB. Just have to remember that there is as 's' at the end of
  the associated word.
  Yeah, to establish a DB association, one thing is the DB with
  the foreign key, and the other is the Schemas.

  We created a new changeset for thread. Inside this new one
  basically we create a new validate and put_assoc to guarantee the
  changes in the schemas.

How does many_to_many works?
  So I created a new Json with new schema and context
  the associated previous context now add a new many_to_many
  in the fields space.
  i.e: many_to_many :newTable, NewContext, join_through:   OtherNewContext
  then in the schema file that the many_to_many references add:
  belongs_to :contexOwnerInSingular , ContextName
  (obs: if there are referencedContext_id, remove)


How to create primary keys in the Database?
  Inside a migration file add:
  create(unique_index(:tablename, [:fieldName]))


How does the references work in phx.gen.html?
  field_id:references:table_name

What the unique_constraint do?
  Something related to just have one of that record field in the database.
  But thats not what create(unique_index(:tablename,
  [:fieldName])) should do? ( this is in the migration file)

Whats the difference between create(unique_index) and unique_constraint?
  The first thing that I can tell is that the create unique index is in a migration id.
  And the unique_constraint id inside a context schema file.
  I think that if you create one, the other is necessary.

How Do I authorizate an application in github
----------------------------- LANGUAGE_LIKE_QUESTIONS --------

What does the Bang (!)  symbol means?
  Probably there is another function with the same name, but each of them handles erros ins a different manner.

What does the --sup while creating a project does?
  R: It creates a folder with the name of the project with an application.ex. Inside there is a start/2 function that contains a vector with children - that supose to be child processes - and this:
  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: Tanto.Supervisor]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)

    start_link/3 and start/3 functions that create new processes.

What is a Application Pattern?
  Takes care of the question? "Where ti divide a monolith into
  services?".
  What are applications?
    Are supervised units of code that start and stops as a single
    entity.

  What are casts?
    They are similar ti calls, but the don't return a specific
    reply; so the caller wont wait for one.

What are OTP Behaviors?
  Probably the name of the patterns.

----------------------------- FRONT_END_LIKE_QUESTIONS -----

    yarn add --dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015
    # Then our webpack bits. There's a lot here. Some would come in as dependencies
    # of others but I thought it was worthwhile to show everything we're using
    yarn add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server
    # And all the webpack packages we're using
    yarn add --dev copy-webpack-plugin extract-text-webpack-plugin css-loader file-loader import-glob-loader node-sass sass-loader style-loader url-loader write-file-webpack-plugin

How do I add Elm to an Application?

-------------------------- TESTING -------------

  a list with attributes, example:

How to integrate wallaby in your project?
  {:wallaby, "~> 0.17.0", only: [:test]}
  Then start Wallaby in the test_helper:
  # in the last line
    {:ok, _} = Application.ensure_all_started(:wallaby) # <--
  Then modify the endpoint:
  if Application.get_env(:projectName, :sql_sanbox) do
    plug(Phoenix.Ecto.SQL.Sandbox)
  end
  Then alter the config/test.exs
  #in the last line
  config :projectName, sql_sandbox: true
  and
  server: true
  Now a little bit of configuration:
  Open test_helper again, at the end addj:
  Application.put_env(:wallaby, :base_url, ProjectName.Web.Endpoint.url)
  Then Build out case template:

  defmodule ProjectName.FeatureCase do
  use ExUnit.CaseTemplate

  using do
    quote do
      use Wallaby.DSL

      alias ProjectName.Repo
      import Ecto
      import Ecto.Changeset
      import Ecto.Query

      import ProjectName.Web.Router.Helpers
    end
  end

  setup tags do
    :ok = Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.checkout( ProjectName.Repo)

    unless tags[:async] do
      Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.mode( ProjectName.Repo, {:shared, self()})
    end

    metadata = Phoenix.Ecto.SQL.Sandbox.metadata_for( ProjectName.Repo, self())
    {:ok, session} = Wallaby.start_session(metadata: metadata)
    {:ok, session: session}
  end
end
