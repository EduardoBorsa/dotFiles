How to work with associations?

  In the schema file, add the association.
  i.e: has_may(:threads, Thread).
  In this case, the category has many thread, but nothings says
  that it has this, I mean, in the DB
  The posts already had foreign keys to user and thread, In the
  schema we changed the "user_id, :id" and thread_id for
  belongs_to :user, User.
  It seams to me that the has_many realy means nothing for the
  DB. Just have to remember that there is as 's' at the end of
  the associated word.
  Yeah, to establish a DB association, one thing is the DB with
  the foreign key, and the other is the Schemas.

  We created a new changeset for thread. Inside this new one
  basically we create a new validate and put_assoc to guarantee the
  changes in the schemas.

How does many_to_many works?
  So I created a new Json with new schema and context
  the associated previous context now add a new many_to_many
  in the fields space.
  i.e: many_to_many :newTable, NewContext, join_through:   OtherNewContext
  then in the schema file that the many_to_many references add:
  belongs_to :contexOwnerInSingular , ContextName
  (obs: if there are referencedContext_id, remove)


How to create primary keys in the Database?
  Inside a migration file add:
  create(unique_index(:tablename, [:fieldName]))


How does the references work in phx.gen.html?
  field_id:references:table_name

What the unique_constraint do?
  Something related to just have one of that record field in the database.
  But thats not what create(unique_index(:tablename,
  [:fieldName])) should do? ( this is in the migration file)

Whats the difference between create(unique_index) and unique_constraint?
  The first thing that I can tell is that the create unique index is in a migration id.
  And the unique_constraint id inside a context schema file.
  I think that if you create one, the other is necessary.
