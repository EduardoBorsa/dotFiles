-------------- Start of Links --------
#a1) what does IO.inspect("string Value")?
  A: Prints the string value in the screen.

#a2) How to Spawn Processes in Elixir?
  spawn(ModuleName, :functionName, [parameters])

#a3) How is the string concatenation in Elixir?
  <>

#a4) What is the the alias __MODULE__?
  It alias the current module

#a5) What does the @enforce_keys does?
  To ensure that when we create a new struct, all attributes that
  are inside the enforce keys must be filled.
  i.e: @enforce_keys [:row,col]
       defstruct [:row, :col]

#a6) What are some mix tasks?
  mix docs - show docs

#a7) What is function arity?
  The nuber of arguments you can pass to the function.

#a8) What are guards in a function?
  They are special filters for the function match in a call.
  i.e: def (x, y) when is_number(x) and is_number(y), do: x+y
  The possible guards are:
  is_atom/1        is_binary/1     is_float/1    is_function/1
  is_list/1        is_map/1        is_pid/1      is_port/1
  is_bitstring/1   is_function/2   is_nil/1      is_reference/1
  is_boolean/1     is_integer/1    is_number/1   is_tuple/1


#a9) What does the Bang (!)  symbol means?
  Probably there is another function with the same name, but each of them handles erros ins a different manner.

#a10) What does the --sup while creating a project does?
  R: It creates a folder with the name of the project with an application.ex. Inside there is a start/2 function that contains a vector with children - that supose to be child processes - and this:
  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: Tanto.Supervisor]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)

#a11) What is an OTP supervision tree?

#a12) What is child process

#a13) What is a worker is elixir?

#a14) what does IO.inspect("string Value")?
  A: Prints the string value in the screen.


#a18) What does the @enforce_keys does?
  To ensure that when we create a new struct, all attributes that
  are inside the enforce keys must be filled.
  i.e: @enforce_keys [:row,col]
       defstruct [:row, :col]

#a19) What are some mix tasks?

  The possible guards are:
  is_atom/1        is_binary/1     is_float/1    is_function/1
  is_list/1        is_map/1        is_pid/1      is_port/1
  is_bitstring/1   is_function/2   is_nil/1      is_reference/1
  is_boolean/1     is_integer/1    is_number/1   is_tuple/1




#a26) What is a worker is elixir?

#a27) How to start new workers?

#a28) What are processes?

#a29) What is the circuit breaker pattern?

#a30) What is OTP?
  Open Telecom Platform. It is a set of design patterns

#a31) What is a GenServer Pattern?
  What does it already sets for me?
    start_link/3 and start/3 functions that create new processes.

#a32) What is a Application Pattern?
  Takes care of the question? "Where ti divide a monolith into
  services?".
#a33) What are applications?
    Are supervised units of code that start and stops as a single
    entity.

#a34) What are casts?
    They are similar ti calls, but the don't return a specific
    reply; so the caller wont wait for one.

#a35) What are OTP Behaviors?
  Probably the name of the patterns.
