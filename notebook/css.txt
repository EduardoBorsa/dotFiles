  ----------------

#a01) RSCSS is a library?
  R: No, it is just a methodology.


#a02) How to add good CSS to project?
  1) in Assets ->
    yarn add sass-brunch --dev
  2) mv app.css to app.scss
  3) yarn add --dev purecss normalize-scss typeplate-starter-kit
  4) config Webpack
  5)
    # We'll add babel's packages
    yarn add --dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015
    # Then our webpack bits. There's a lot here. Some would come in as dependencies
    # of others but I thought it was worthwhile to show everything we're using
    yarn add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server
    # And all the webpack packages we're using
    yarn add --dev copy-webpack-plugin extract-text-webpack-plugin css-loader file-loader import-glob-loader node-sass sass-loader style-loader url-loader write-file-webpack-plugin

#a03) How do I add Elm to an Application?

#a04) How to add sass to an Pheonix App?
    yarn add sass-brunch --dev
    then just change *.css to *.scss

#a05) How to Organize your CSS folder structure?
  O the app.scss shout just have imports
  Then create filder for:
    components
    pages
    layout
  On the root of the css folder, should have _settings files, ie:
    _settings.metrics.scss

#a06) How to create constantes in SASS?
  Put a $ in front of it, i.e:
  $border-radius: .25rem;

#a07) What are and how works: PureCss, normalize-scss, Typeplate?
  PureCss -> A set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project
  Normalize -> A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets.
               Makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
               It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
  Typeplate -> Frameworks make decisions for you about how to organize, structure and design a site.
               Pattern libraries don’t separate styling and markup, making them tough to use in a truly modular fashion.
               We weren’t satisfied, so we made a thing that doesn’t do that.

  Create _generic.NameOfLibrary.sccs with content of it, i.e
  vim _generic.typeplate.scss
  // Typeplate - http://typeplate.com/
  @import "typeplate-index";

  Then add on Brunch config:
