#a01) RSCSS is a library?
  R: No, it is just a methodology.


#a02) How to add good CSS to project?
  1) in Assets -> yarn add sass-brunch --dev
  2) mv app.css to app.scss
  3) yarn add --dev purecss normalize-scss typeplate-starter-kit
  4) config Webpack
  5)
    # We'll add babel's packages
    yarn add --dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015
    # Then our webpack bits. There's a lot here. Some would come in as dependencies
    # of others but I thought it was worthwhile to show everything we're using
    yarn add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server
    # And all the webpack packages we're using
    yarn add --dev copy-webpack-plugin extract-text-webpack-plugin css-loader file-loader import-glob-loader node-sass sass-loader style-loader url-loader write-file-webpack-plugin
