#a01 How does handle_cast and handle_call differentiate from one another?
  A: When you send a GenServer.call(pid, :message), the call will expect a reply. But if you send a
  GenServer.cast(pid, :message), it will no wait for a reply

#a02 What is necessary to use a GenServer?
  It needs to implement the init/1 callback

#a03 What are all the GenServer callbacks?

#a04 How to register a process?
  {:ok, _} = GenServer.start_link(Stack, [:hello], name: MyStack)
  It doesn't matter the process pid, now we can call it by MyStack

#a05 What are general warning of GenServer?
  1) Never implement receive do calls inside callbacks
