  ---------------

#a01)  How does Phoenix.HTML works?
  * The link function inside this module works as an anger Tag.
    i.e: <%= link("Text of the link"), to: "/path/you/want",
    class= "bootstrap-classes-names"%>

  * form_for -> helps to create forms. Check the url: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html


#a02)  Why when you nest a controller inside another, you have to override the action/2 (action(conn,_) function? What is this funcion?

#a03)  What is an endpoint in a web application?

#a04) How to create a Json API with Phoenix?
  mix phx.gen.json SchemaName ContextName tableName attributes
      ---------------Inside the Business Part ----
      Created a new SchemaFile.ex and Context.ex inside the new SchemaNameFolder
      and a migration
      and tests related
      ---------------Inside the Web Part ----------
      created a context controller, view
      a changeset_view (pra que serve isso?)
      a fallback_controller (pra que serve isso?)
      and tests related


#a05)  What is an schema in Phoenix?

#a06)  How does the mix phx.gen.html works?
  R: I think it is:
      mix phx.gen.html SchemaName ContextName tableName atributes
      ---------------Inside the Business Part ----
      In the business part of the system, it creates a folder with SchemaDirectory and create a SchemaName.ex with its name, i.e forums.ex. It also creates a context.ex .
      Inside the SchemaName.ex file is where all the CRUD operations of all the business logics inside the SchemaDirectory wiil be stored.
      The ContextName.ex will hold all the atributes and changeset of the new context.
      ---------------Inside the Web Part ----------
      In the webPart of the system, it creates a schemaName_controller in the controller folder. And creates a folder inside templates with schemaName with the html.eex files. Also creates inside view a schemaName_view
      inside the controller is the webconventions functions of: (1) index, (2) new, (3) create, (4) show, (5) edit, (6) update and (7) delete.

#a07)  What is the config/config.ex file?


#a08)  How do I use Phoenix Sign up.



#a09)  How do I create a Oauth on github:
  1) settings
  2) Developer Settings
  3) New Oauth App
  4) App_Name: Name,
     Localhost: localhost:4000,
     Authorization_URL: localhost:4000/auth/github
  5) Create a .env file inside config/, i.e -> ./config/.env
  6) add the environment variable as example:
                                              export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<My Github client id>"
                                              export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<My Github Client Secret>"
  7) Before Running the Application, use the command:
                                                    source ./config/.env

#a10)  How can I authenticate a user?
  Using OAuth -
    1) Add in mix these two:  {:ueberauth, "~> 0.4"},
                              {:ueberauth_github, "~> 0.4"}
    2) Add the following config:  config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
                                  providers: [
                                    # We don't need any permissions on GitHub as we're just using it as an
                                    # identity provider, so we'll set an empty default scope.
                                    github: {Ueberauth.Strategy.Github, [default_scope: ""]}
                                  ]

                                  # We also need a github client id and secret. I've already generated an
                                  # application on github and I've stored these secrets somewhere...secret.
                                  config :ueberauth, Ueberauth.Strategy.Github.OAuth,
                                    client_id: System.get_env("GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"),
                                    client_secret: System.get_env("GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET")
    3) Inside the router.ex, add ueberauth to plug stack:
       * in the first prosition of Browser pipeline add: plug(Ueberauth)
       And add a scope for the authAuthentication, as, exmaple:
                                                              scope "/auth", FirestormWeb.Web do
                                                              pipe_through :browser

                                                              delete "/logout", AuthController, :delete
                                                              get "/logout", AuthController, :delete
                                                              get "/:provider", AuthController, :request
                                                              get "/:provider/callback", AuthController, :callback
                                                              post "/:provider/callback", AuthController, :callback
                                                            end


#a11)  How do I authenticate users using comeonin?
  add the librarie: comeonin 4.0
                    bcrypt_elixir 1.0

  It is needed to create a new changeset for the registration
  that will hold some validate_required fields.
  Alse, we'll need to create a digest function like this one:
  defp put_pass_digest(changeset) do
    case changeset do
    %Ecto.Changeset{valid?: true, changes: %{password: pass}} ->
      put_change(changeset, :password_digest, Comeonin.Bcrypt.hashpwsalt(pass))
    _ ->
      changeset
    end
  end

#a12)  How to enable log in?
  Create a SchemaAuthController wit:
  init
  call

#a13)  How to restrict unauthenticated?
  in the controller of the function you want to restrict, plug
  an authenticate function to it
  i.e: plug :authenticate when action in [:functionToRestrict]

#a14) What does unique constrain in the changeset does?
  Creates an error related to de creation of a unique index in the table. If it is not there, the
  application will not know what happened.

#a15) How to get a param from a session?
  player_id = get_session(conn, :player_id)

#a16) How to create a controller Api for any Context?

#a17) How does the functions in the *.html.eex function?
  They are the ones in the *.view.ex . Some of them are already native of the file.


#a18) How to nest a controller inside another?
  Overtide the action/2 function inside the controller that will be nested inside, i.e:
  def action(conn, _) do
    parent = Schema.get_parent!(conn.params["parent_id"])
    args = [conn, conn.params, parent]
    apply(__MODULE__, action_name(conn), args)
  end
  inside every other fucntion inside this nested controller, add the parent as arg and pass as
  arguments in the Schema functions inside this fucntions. change also nested_path to
  parent_nested_path
  Refactor also the Schema functions, the ones that now will receive the parent as argument.
  and the templates. (inside this, the path now will be, parent_nested_path())

#a19) How to substitute Brunch for Webpack?
  get the webpack file at files.
  add:
  yarn add --dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015
  yarn add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server
  yarn add --dev copy-webpack-plugin extract-text-webpack-plugin css-loader file-loader import-glob-loader node-sass sass-loader style-loader url-loader write-file-webpack-plugin
  npm install webpack-cli -D
  then inside app.js, put:
  // We'll require our CSS file, which doesn't yet exist
  require("../css/app.scss");
  // And we'll load the phoenix_html javascript from the elixir package
  import "../../deps/phoenix_html/priv/static/phoenix_html";

 curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{"clients": {"name": "Blaaa" }}'
 http://localhost:4000/api/clients


#a20) Hpw to Create Routes?
  Just add them in the router and the *_path is created

#a21) How to patterns match with the conn?
  %{"field" => value}

#a22) Json APi new thoughts:
  new controller, view e test.
  changeset_view -> Traverse and translate changeset errors
  fallback_controller -> Translates controller action results into valid `Plug.Conn` responses.
